# Programming Assignment 1

---

Hi TA! We submitted 2 deliveries (the second one is not here yet, will get it done next week) for this project. For your convenience we have marked tag on each of them, so you may simply:

```
git checkout tags/p2c1r    # Project 2 Commit 1 (Submission for Programming) 10/9
git checkout tags/p2c2r    # Project 1 Commit 2 (Regular Submission for Jupyter Notebook) 10/16
```

And do the grading. Thank you.

**Note per the `p2c1r` tag, we have done all programming (for all `60` points) by 10/09/2020 but I don't know if this constitutes a partial early submission for Commit 2.** If so, please mercy us with the 10% bonus on 30 marks for early submission of Commit 2 Programming; if not, please just ignore it and grade it as a regular submission. Thank you!
