## To TA/Grader

Since we have decided to migrate the collaboration to `GitHub` for better readability and potential useful features like [*issues*](https://github.com/choH/eecs391_programming_exercises/issues), this repository
will be mirror to and bare-clone from `csevcs` at least once a week.

Also, we realized many projects of this class requires quite intensive amount of debugging, so sometime we'd work on the same computer and therefore submitted in a fashion of `co-author`.

## To Partner

Usually I will polish our repository before mirroring, but in case that I am not available and you need to mirror our work to `csevcs`, please do:

```
your_work_dir $ git clone --bare https://github.com/choH/csds440_programming_exercises
your_work_dir $ cd csds440_programming_exercises.git
csds440_programming_exercises $ git push --mirror https://csevcs.case.edu/git/2020_fall_440_27
```

Note this maneuver will completely overwrite the repository on `csevcs` â€” which shouldn't be a big deal since all our development are initiated here, but please be caution.
