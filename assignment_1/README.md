# Programming Assignment 1

---

We have submitted 3 deliveries for this project. For your convenience we have marked tag on each of them, so you may simply:

```
git checkout tags/p1c1e    # Project 1 Commit 1 (Early Submission for Programming)
git checkout tags/p1c2e    # Project 1 Commit 2 (Early Submission for Programming)
git checkout tags/p1c2r    # Project 1 Commit 2 (Regular Submission for Jupyter Notebook)
```

And do the grading. Thank you.

## 09/18/2020 Commit 1 (Early Submission for Programming)

We are mostly trying with the shell and be familiar with the format and requirement of the assignment for this week. We also put in some basic infra for the tree.

### Henry

* Implemented `entropy()`, `GR()`, will be responsible for implementing calculative methods like `IG()` for this assignment.
* Implemented basic structure of the tree with Tie.
* I personally haven't experience much with the API and I am more on the calculative parts. But we tried some printing on playground file, with the python nature it is not too hard.

### Mingyang

* Sketched the design of the project.
* Manipulate data set.

## 09/25/2020 Commit 2 (Partial Early Submission for Programming)

We finished our implementation on `Desision Tree Learner` but still working on the `Jupyter Notebook`. We submitted  here for early submission credits.

### Henry
* Refactor entropy calculative methods.
* Implement basic TreeNode and ID3 structure.
* Implement `IG` `GR` methods and corresponding tree generation.
* Implement performance display.


### Mingyang
* Support continuous data manipulation.
* Implement tree generation and logic.
* Cross validation and its corresponding coupling.
* Command line arguments parser.
* Extensive debugging.

### API
* We have not experienced much difficulty with API as the only module needed is the data, with the parser provided they are not too hard to use.
* We do noticed some low performance with no depth requirement, we suspect this is due to overfitting, but not sure.

## 10/02/2020 Commit 2 (Regular Submission for Jupyter Notebook)

Note last week (09/25/2020) we submitted our programming for early submission, but we didn't finished our Notebook (except the coding for `(d)`). So this is a regular submission for the Jupyter Notebook.

### Henry
* Run results for `(c)`.
* Plot `(c)`.
* Discussed analysis together.

### Mingyang
* Run results for `(a)` to `(b)`, especially for spam.
* Designed split criterion for `(d)`.
* Discussed analysis together.

### API
* We have no API feedback as we've done all coding by the pervious commit. However, the `spam` dataset seems to be way too big to run a personal computer. We have to borrow a server to do it.
