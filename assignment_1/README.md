# Programming Assignment 1

---

## Week 1 (Early Submission `e7274a8`)

We are mostly trying with the shell and be familiar with the format and requirement of the assignment for this week. We also put in some basic infra for the tree.

### Henry

* Implemented `entropy()`, `GR()`, will be responsible for implementing calculative methods like `IG()` for this assignment.
* Implemented basic structure of the tree with Tie.
* I personally haven't experience much with the API and I am more on the calculative parts. But we tried some printing on playground file, with the python nature it is not too hard.

### Mingyang

* Sketched the design of the project.
* Manipulate data set.

## Week 2 (Partial Early Submission `015926e`)

We finished our implementation on `Desision Tree Learner` but still working on the `Jupyter Notebook`. We submitted  here for early submission credits.

### Henry
* Refactor entropy calculative methods.
* Implement basic TreeNode and ID3 structure.
* Implement `IG` `GR` methods and corresponding tree generation.
* Implement performance display.


### Mingyang
* Support continuous data manipulation.
* Implement tree generation and logic.
* Cross validation and its corresponding coupling.
* Command line arguments parser.
* Extensive debugging.

### API
* We have not experienced much difficulty with API as the only module needed is the data, with the parser provided they are not too hard to use.
* We do noticed some low performance with no depth requirement, we suspect this is due to overfitting, but not sure.
