# Programming Assignment 1

---

## Week 1 (Early Submission)

We are mostly trying with the shell and be familiar with the format and requirement of the assignment for this week. We also put in some basic infra for the tree.

### Henry

* Implemented `entropy()`, `GR()`, will be responsible for implementing calculative methods like `IG()` for this assignment.
* Implemented basic structure of the tree with Tie.
* I personally haven't experience much with the API and I am more on the calculative parts. But we tried some printing on playground file, with the python nature it is not too hard.

### Mingyang

* Sketched the design of the project.
* Manipulate data set.
