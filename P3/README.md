Hi TA! We submitted 2 deliveries (the second one is not here yet, will get it done next week) for this project. For your convenience we have marked tag on each of them, so you may simply:

```
git checkout tags/p3c1r    # Project 2 Commit 1 (Submission for Programming) 11/13
```

And do the grading. Thank you.
